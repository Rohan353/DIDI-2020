Build 0.1:

First prototype of p2p network with cache server & client node
Client node is nearly complete and cache server needs some additional work for the server node to work

Build 0.2 (1/1/2021):

p2p network nearly finished. 
Server node has been coded and lot of work has gone into the cache server to ensure it runs smoothly keeping the network operational and also making sure that all server nodes have a roughly equal share of the clients (so no manipulation of the servers can happen). Client node has also been updated to ensure compatability with the other two programs. CSV files for the server & cache server have also been added since they were not present in the other build.
